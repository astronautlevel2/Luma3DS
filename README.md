# astronautlevel2.github.io
A small site and script made to automatically build the latest rxTools every night and add it to a website

TODO:
 * Find another way to store builds before I run out of github space
 * ~~Implement a way to only build new commits to save space~~ Done!
 * Make it look nicer
